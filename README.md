#Intermediate Vector Operations

This example explains the Magnitude, Dot Product, and Cross Product operations, with geometric considerations.

The magnitude of a vector, commonly denoted ||__x__||, is its length in n-dimensional space.  This can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem.

The dot product, also called the scalar product or inner product and commonly denoted __x__ &middot; __y__, is a binary operation that takes two nD vectors and returns a real number based on how much the vectors "point in the same direction."

The cross product, commonly denoted __x__ &times; __y__, is a binary operation only defined in 3D space that returns another 3D vector that is perpendicular to both __x__ and __y__ according to the right hand rule, with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram enclosed by __x__ and __y__.

#Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.  In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor. Windows has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
